Hi! I'm Pavan Thodima, a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I'm currently interested in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, **Game Theory**, and **Computer Systems**.

Before joining UW-Madison, I worked for three years as a Software Engineer at **BNY** (Bank of New York Mellon), where I gained valuable industry experience in building scalable systems.

I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI and ML, particularly in areas that combine theoretical rigor with practical applications. My long-term goal is to contribute to advancing the field through impactful research.
