Hi, I'm Pavan. I am an **MS Computer Science student at UW-Madison** and a former **Senior Software Engineer at BNY Mellon**.

I bridge the gap between **theoretical AI** and **scalable production systems**. With **3 years of industry experience** architecting financial systems and current research in **Computer Vision**, **Game Theory**, and **Generative AI**, I build machine learning solutions that are both rigorous and deployable.

### 🚀 **Open to Opportunities**
**I am currently seeking Software Engineering and Machine Learning Engineering internships for Summer 2026.**

<hr style="clear:both;">

### **What I Do**

*   **Research:** My current work focuses on the internal dynamics of **Diffusion Models** and cooperative reasoning in **LLMs** (Game Theory). I am also working on **High-Fidelity Image Reconstruction** from Quanta sensors at the [Wision Lab](https://wisionlab.cs.wisc.edu/).
*   **Engineering:** At **BNY**, I architected critical regulatory reporting systems, managed releases, and led the transition to Agile methodologies. I have deep expertise in **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Angular**, and **Cloud Infrastructure (AWS/Docker)**.
*   **Systems:** I enjoy building low-level deep learning tools, such as my own [C++ & CUDA Deep Learning Framework](/projects/2_cpp_framework/) built from scratch.

This website documents my projects and research. Feel free to [browse my projects](/projects/) or check out my [CV](/cv/).
