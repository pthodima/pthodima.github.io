## Overview

Developed a real-time **Hand Sign Recognition** system capable of identifying and classifying hand gestures.

## Methodology

*   **Computer Vision Techniques:** Utilized **OpenCV** for image pre-processing, including:
    *   Skin color segmentation.
    *   **Convex Hull** generation to outline the hand shape.
    *   **Convexity Defects** calculation to count fingers and analyze gestures.
*   **Classification:** Experimented with both heuristic-based approaches (finger counting) and **Neural Networks** for robust classification of complex signs.

## Tech Stack
*   **OpenCV**
*   **Python**
*   **Machine Learning**
